# Automatic-Fish-Feeder-using-Arduino-uno
An automatic fish feeder is a device that automatically feed the fish predetermined time. In a way, it is to control the fish feeding activity by using a fish feeder that combined the mechanical system and electrical system to form a device instead of manually feeding the fish by hand. Fish owners whom are away for a long time will have trouble knowing the situation of the pond or aquarium. Thus such device is very convenient. At the same time we also monitor the completion of food in the container and make the buzzer rings.
